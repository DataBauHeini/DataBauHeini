# Hi, I'm Simon 👋

MSc in Applied Information and Data Science | Data Analyst → Data Scientist

## About Me
I'm currently working as a Data Analyst in the energy sector, focusing on load forecasting, production planning, and data-driven decision-making. 

My background spans mechanical engineering, digitalization, and quantitative analysis. I believe the best data science comes from deeply understanding the domain you're working in.

## Current Focus
- Time series forecasting (energy production & consumption)
- Building analytics infrastructure for operational use
- Transitioning from BI/reporting to predictive modeling

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, DAX, M, SQL
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, Jupyter, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Power BI, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Currently Learning**: scikit-learn, Prophet, MLOps basics

## Projects
🚧 Work in progress – check back soon for energy forecasting projects!

## Connect
- further information maybe later..
- Currently based in: deep in the mountains, Switzerland (open to DACH region)
